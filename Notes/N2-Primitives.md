# Variables
- Creating variables: In Java, creating a variable involves specifying data type and 
giving it a name. WHen you create a variable, you are reserving a space in the memory
to store a value. These stored values can be used by our programs later on in the code.
    * Formula of creating a variable in java:
    ```java
      dataType variableName = valueForTheVariable ;
    ```
* **Why do we create variables?**
    - Store and reuse the data through out your program.
    - They make it easier to manipulate values and keep track of information.
* **NOTE!** To be able to create a variable we must use appropriate data types for 
the values.

# Primitives 
- Primitives are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language
and directly represent the values they store.
- Features:
    - They are stored in memory and are very fast to access.
    - Each prmitive has a fixed size, which helps efficent usage in memory.
    - Primitives are not OBJECTS.
  
## Types of Primitives
- There are 8 different primitive data type and most commonly used ones are 
`int`,`double` and `boolean`.
- Let's categorize the primitive data types:
    1. **Numerical Primitive Data Types**
        - `float`, `double`, `byte`,`short`,`int` and `long`.
        - **Whole Number Primitives**
            - `byte`,`short`,`int` and `long`.
            - These can store whole numbers without a decimal point.
        - **Float Number Primitives**
            - `float` and `double`.
            - These data types can store numbers with decimal points like `3.5`,`7.9023` etc.
          
    2. **Condition Storage Primitive**
        - `boolean`
        - Boolean in java is used to store whether a statement is true or not.
        - It can only store 2 values -> `true` **OR** `false` .
    
    3. **Character Storage**
        - `char`
        - This data type can store a **single** character. And this character that 
       `char` variable stores **must** be enclosed in a single quotes **' '**
